### Amanda C, Dokyun K, Jun P


```{python}
import cv2 as cv
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def display(image):
    """
    deals with opencv being in BGR and matplotlib being in RGB
    """
    plt.figure()
    plt.imshow(cv.cvtColor(image, cv.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
    plt.show()
```

```{python}
# Load Image
img1 = cv.imread("image1.jpg")
img2 = cv.imread("image2.jpg")
```

### Part 1: Pixel Processing

```{python}
# a) change brightness



# b) change contrast




# c) change brightness of alternating pixels
```

### Part 2: Color Spaces

```{python}
# a) show images in different color spaces (RGB and HSV)


# b) Plot at least 4 different histograms for each image from the various color spaces
```

Were these color spaces useful for your chosen image?

### Part 3: Convolution/linear filtering

```{python}
# a) Apply identity filter to both images




# b) Apply box filter of 2 different sizes to both images (total 4 images)


# c) Think about what a sharpening filter would look like and apply it to your 2 images




# d) Design a 3 x 3 Gaussian filter and apply it to your 2 images
```
